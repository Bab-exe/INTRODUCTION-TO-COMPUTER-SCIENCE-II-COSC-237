COSC 237 Labs Guidelines
1. A lab must be turned in within three days after it takes place (unless otherwise specified in the summer
session) via email address: namnp.tu@gmail.com.
2. Create a folder named “Last_First_LabXX” where XX is the lab ID, e.g., “Smith_David_Lab01” for lab 01.
3. Create a separated file for each programming answer, name them “LabXX.java” where XX is the question
ID, e.g., “Lab01.java” for question 01. For non-programming answers, put your answers in the comment
section of any source code (i.e., .java file).
4. Include all your source code and input files in this folder (no .class files should be included).
5. Zip the folder and submit the zipped file via email with subject “COSC237_Last_First_LabXX” where XX
is the lab ID, e.g., “COSC237_Smith_David_Lab01” for lab 01.
Notes
• NO LATE SUBMISSIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED.
• Failure to follow the submission guidelines will result in 30% grade deduction.
• All labs must be turned in and are subject to grading except for labs 01 and 02. However, not all of them
will be graded. Only five (05) labs, chosen randomly, will be graded.
